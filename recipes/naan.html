        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Naan is a type of leavened, oven-baked flatbread that is popular in South Asian cuisine, particularly in India, Pakistan, and surrounding regions. 
            It is traditionally cooked in a tandoor, a cylindrical clay or metal oven that can reach high temperatures. 
            Naan is known for its soft, pillowy texture and slightly charred, crispy edges. It is often served as a side dish to accompany various curries, stews, and  grilled meats.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>¾ cup warm water (about 110°F)</li>            
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅓ cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil or melted butter, plus more for brushing</li>
        </ul>   

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the yogurt and the yeast mixture. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
            <br>                            
            <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Preheat a skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Punch down the dough and divide it into 6-8 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball and then flatten it into an oval or teardrop shape, about ¼ inch thick.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Place the rolled-out dough onto the hot skillet. Cook for about 1-2 minutes on one side until bubbles form and the bottom is golden brown. Flip it over and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the other side is also golden brown. Repeat with the remaining dough.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Brush the cooked naan with melted butter or oil while it's still warm. Serve immediately with your favorite curries or dishes.</li>
        </ol>
