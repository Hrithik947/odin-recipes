#Odin Recipes

This website is coded in interest of completion of a project of The Odin Project's Foundation Course.

##About the website
It is a completely html based file, atleast in its current iteration it is. I will employ all the relevant html tags, including the assets like images, culminating into a website moderately populated with the recipes from the [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com) website.

View site here: https://hrithik947.github.io/odin-recipes/

##Structure of the project

index.html - Main landing page containing liinks to all recipes

/recipes - Folder containing individual html files for all recipes


##My Learning

1. Creating HTML pages from scratch.

2. Using relative links between pages.

3. Structuring html page with appropriate usage of tags.

4. Understanding of git and github.
